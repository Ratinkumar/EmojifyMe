# Emojify
In this Project Emojify I have created a model which will predict an emoji based on my live expressions. This project is purely based on CNN and Computer Vision. For this project I have created my own dataset and then trained my model with that dataset. I mainly considered five emotions (i.e. Angry, Happy, Sad, Neutral and Shock)

# Tools Required : 
Jupyter Notebook/ Google Colab, Webcam

Language Used : Python 3.11.9

# Methodologies : 
Transfer Learning, CNN, Haar Cascade Classifier, Computer Vision

# Explaining Some Files :

1. Own_face_data :- This contains the dataset of my own face you can also create the dataset in the same manner by using facedata.ipynb code.

2. Raw Emoji :- It contains the emoji downloaded directly from google you have to resize them using Resize_emoji.ipynb code to use them for masking.

3. Emojis :- Here I have saved the resized emojis.
